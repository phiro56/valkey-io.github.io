Adam is an open source programmer who thinks Swift should be used for more than iPhone apps. He is a member of the SSWG (Swift server working group) and maintains a number of libraries in the Swift on server eco-system, including the web framework [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.codes) and [Soto](https://github.com/soto-project/soto) the unofficial Swift SDK for AWS.

In his spare time Adam enjoys cycling, photography and eating out.
